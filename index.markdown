# Drawing Comics Was Hard

[2003 - 2018]
Dabbled with comics and found out that I don't have the stamina to finish them off. My hard lesson here is that it's just not for me. The most I can do is bring it to whatever scribbly looking thing I have here. It was fun to think about stories in panels though.

Nick wrote a story about friendship between a nonchalant dude and a hyper-expressive over-acheiver. He hit me up with turning this into a webtoon, but I cannot bring myself to break away from the graphic novel paneling. Again, this is another unfinished one because life happened.

### Amer's Manga

I can't remember the story for this one. It was always hard for me to wrap my head around what Amer is saying anyway. When I was doing this, I was just starting to learn to draw environments. It was all that anyone will allow me to touch and that was all in my head. This is the point where I found out that I don't have the stamina for drawing comics.

Ok, I totally forgot I made this stickman stuff. Looking back, I sure was a super fun kid /s. My memory is super unreliable here, but I can safely say it's based on the XiaoXiao flash games. I can't believe I was planning a Book 2.
